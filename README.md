Gitwit Project Boilerplate
=============

This boilerplate is the foundation for any Gitwit project. To begin, clone the repository in to your new directory. Each project should be titled "gw-projecttitlehere"

Installation
-----------
To install all of the dev dependencies, you'll need Nodejs installed.

To install all required packages run:
```
npm install
```
Packages include:

* gulp
* browser-sync
* gulp-sass
* jquery

Usage
-----
To run the local server with browser-sync (live reload) run the following in your terminal:

```
gulp
```

In case your local environment doesn't automatically open in your default browser, it will exist at: 

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
